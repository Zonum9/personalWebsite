            Thank you for taking a look at my website! My name is Andres Munoz, a motivated
            X year old developer eager to get into the professional field. <br><br>
            Most of my experience comes from school projects, however I always made sure to go above
            and beyond to ensure that confidently say that I understand what I am doing, and can apply it in the real
            world.
            I am currently enrolled in McGill university and expect to finish my studies in April 2025.

            <br><br>On a personal level, I am a very curious person, always looking for new and interesting topics to
            learn about.
            I also enjoy playing videogames and spending time with my family.

                              This was my final project for college,
                              and it was made in collaboration with 2 other people,
                              who were handling chess engine logic and local online play respectively.
                              All menu logic and controls were implemented by me. I also helped with
                              merging all the individual components together, debugging them and adding additional
                              functionalities to them when necessary.
